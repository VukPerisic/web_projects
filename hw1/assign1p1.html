  <p>Steve Harrington is a fictional character from the Netflix 
      television show Stranger Things, portrayed by Joe Keery. While starting

      development that has received widespread acclaim from critics and 
      fans alike and has led to him becoming one of the show's most 
      beloved and enduring characters. Initially a part of the recurring
      cast, Keery was promoted to the main cast in the second season. Steve 
      is a side antagonist turned protagonist at the end of season 1, and

  <h3>Fictional Character Biography</h3>
  <h4>Season 1</h4>
  <p>Steve is initially portrayed as a stereotypical 1980s popular jock,
      antagonistic and unlikable. Steve had been dating Nancy Wheeler but 
      after he harasses Jonathan Byers by breaking his camera, Nancy seems
      to have become close to Jonathan. Steve accosts Jonathan, but 
      the latter beats him in a fight and Steve sees the error of his ways and 
      ignores his former "friends". Traveling to the Byers' home to 
      apologize, he becomes involved in Nancy and Jonathan's fight 
      against the Demogorgon, which they defeat. At the conclusion of 
      the season, Nancy buys Jonathan a new camera and Steve continues 
      his relationship with Nancy. 
  </p>
  <h4>Season 2</h4>
  <p>Steve's relationship with Nancy is stressed, and he breaks up with 
      her after she will not say she loves him. He calls her out after her 
      drunken tirade at a party where she calls their relationship fake. 
      Steve also finds himself at odds with Billy Hargrove, a new student at
      the school who seeks to become its tough guy. Steve becomes involved with
      Mike Wheeler and his friends after Dustin asks him to help find his 
      "pet" D'Artagnan, unaware it is a Demogorgon. Steve and Dustin bond 
      over how to talk to girls, and soon Steve also takes Mike, Lucas, and
      Billy's stepsister Max under his wing. Steve protects the children as 
      Demodogs start ravaging across Hawkins, giving time for Eleven 
      and Jim Hopper to close the gate to the Upside Down, and for Will 
      Byers to have the Mind Flayer exorcised from his body. He also 
      defends the kids against Billy, and is knocked unconscious before 
      Max is able to disable her brother.
